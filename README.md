# Lab: Simple Visual Odometry

This lab will be similar to [the pose estimation lab](https://github.com/tek5030/lab-pose-estimation-py), but we will now create our own 3D maps instead of relying on known planar world points.
This will also enable us to implement a very naive visual odometry method.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the lab project.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Calibrate the camera](lab-guide/2-calibrate-the-camera.md)
3. [Finish TwoViewRelativePoseEstimator](lab-guide/3-finish-twoviewrelativeposeestimator.md)
4. [Further experiments](lab-guide/4-finish-dltpointsestimator.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
